# Spotify__Song_Suggester
Suggests songs given input criteria.

This program produces song suggestions, using the Spotify API, based on an inputted song (or artist) and the user's choice of six song metrics, such as
beats per minutes, instrumentalness, etc. The program then creates an algorithm given the chosen metrics to find similar songs.
